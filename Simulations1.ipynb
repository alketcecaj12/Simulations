    "### Simulations\n",
    "Simulations are a class of computational algorithms that use the relatively simple idea of random sampling to solve increasingly complex problems. Although they have been around for ages, they have gained in popularity recently due to the rise in computational power and have seen applications in multiple domains including Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Computational Biology and Finance just to name a few. Students will use simulations to generate and analyze data over different probability distributions using the important NumPy package. This course will give students hands-on experience with simulations using simple, real-world applications.\n",

    "### Introduction to random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is a quantity that can take on multiple values based on random chance. When the variable can take on infinitely many values, it's called a continuous random variable. Think about the height of a person. Although the height lies within some reasonable limits on average, the actual value could have infinite possibilities in that interval. That is why we term it as a continuous random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the variable can only take a finite set of values, it is called a discrete random variable. The roll of a six-sided die can have only one of six possible outcomes and is thus, considered a discrete random variable. Next, let's look at probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a mapping from the set of possible outcomes of a random variable to the probability of observing that outcome. It tells you how likely you are to observe a given outcome or a set of outcomes. Just like random variables, probability distributions are either discrete or continuous depending on the type of random variable they represent. For continuous random variables, the distribution is represented by a probability density function and probability is typically defined over an interval. The normal distribution is an example of a continuous distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete random variables, the distribution is represented by a probability mass function and probability can be defined at a single point or over an interval. Among discrete distributions, binomial and Poisson distributions are widely used. Python's numpy random module is a robust and flexible tool that lets us work with random variables.\n"

Simulations are typically characterized by repeated random sampling, which means that we use the power of random variables to generate multiple outcomes.\n",

Since both die A and B are fair dice, we can use identical probability distributions. Also since the probability of seeing each outcome is the same, this is a uniform distribution.\n",
